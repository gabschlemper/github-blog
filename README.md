# My GitHub Blog Challenge

## Introduction

Hello, developers!

Welcome to my GitHub Blog challenge, which I successfully completed as part of the ReactJS track in **Ignite**. In this challenge, I had the opportunity to utilize the GitHub API to create a personal blog.

This challenge required a bit of knowledge beyond what was covered in the module, but I embraced the learning process and successfully built a fantastic blog. The experience was valuable, and I'm excited to share it with you! ðŸ’œ

## About My Challenge

In this challenge, I developed an application that leverages the GitHub API to fetch issues from a repository, retrieve my profile data, and display them as a blog. The key features I implemented include:

- **Profile Listing:** I displayed my GitHub profile information, including my profile picture, the number of followers, my name, and other information available from the GitHub API.

- **Listing and Filtering Issues:** I listed and filtered all issues from a GitHub repository. Each issue had a brief summary of its content.

- **Complete Post (Issue) Page:** I created a dedicated page to display a full blog post (issue) with all details.

Despite the relatively few features, I had to revisit and apply the following concepts:

- Fetch / Axios
- Routing and React Router DOM
- Forms
